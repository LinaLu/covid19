# Project summary

## Data ##
The raw data can be downloaded  *[here](https://www.kaggle.com/marianarfranklin/mexico-covid19-clinical-data)* It consists roughly of 26 300 patient data, such as gender, age and different medical condition.
The data cleaning are done in a R-script *(data/data_cleaning.R)*.
From the raw data only records with patient that has died from Covid19 is kept (4542), and this subset of data are used to build our model, that will predict the likelihood for dying in a Covid-19 infection.

Initially below features where kept as potential candidates for the model features:
- Gender
- DateOfDeath
- Neumonia
- Age
- Pregnant
- Diabetes
- Astma
- ImmunoSuppressed
- Hypertension
- Cardiovascular
- Obese
- Smoking


# Data model
The data model are build and trained using jupyter notebook(**data/model_discovery.ipynb**).
NA values for pregnancy are imputed by the median value along all data.
Since the target variable is binary (surviving or not surviving Covid-19), the logistic regression is used.

Further the features with highest k scores are selected for the model.
The number of features are further narrowed down based on their internal correlations, since logistic regression require no or little correlations between the independent variables (features).

The resulting features used to train the model are following:
- Age
- Gender  
- Neumonia       
- Obese 


**Start jupyter notebook**
Ensure the server is running to run the jupyter notebook.

```
$ cd covid19
$ jupyter notebook
```

# Save and test the trained model
The trained model need to be saved in the folder **server** in order to run a quick sanity py-test.
Anytime the model is retrained or modify, the new model need to be manually moved to the folder.

Run the testfile **test_model_sanity.py**.

```
cp ./data/covid19_model_to_be_tested.sav
./server/covid19_model_v1.sav
```

# Improvements
Naturally the selection of model and features selection deserve much more time and finetuning, than what has been given in this ad hoc project.
