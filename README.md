# Covid-19 Risk Analysis Client
Application that calculates the risk of hospitalization due to a covid-19.

It is based on a naive model that only uses age and gender to predict the risk of hospitalisation.
The intention of this application is to showcase a potential usage of public availble data, and also serve as a MVP.
